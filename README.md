# Mac-OS-animated-background
Fun simple script to make your desktop background animated.

You can change the a.gif for whatever video you want.
The default script splits the video to 10 frames, you can change that for longer videos.
Run the following commands to get it working.

```console
foo@bar:~$ python3.6 video.py a.gif
foo@bar:~$ python3.6 play.py
```
